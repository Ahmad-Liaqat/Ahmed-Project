        <h3>My experiences:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>My personal problems, particularly my financial ones since I grew up in a middle-class home, significantly influenced my outlook on life. Working hard has been a core life principle of my life since I have always witnessed others working hard to achieve their goals. Along with this, I also think one should work as wisely as possible and as needed because overworking oneself and disrupting one's state of mind simply results in burnout and decreased productivity.</p>
