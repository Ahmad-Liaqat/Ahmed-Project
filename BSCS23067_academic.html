        <li>I completed my middleschool in Hala International School Jeddah.</li>
        <li>I did my matriculation from Aligarh Publich School.</li>
        <li>I then did my Alevels from Garrison Academy for Cambridge Studies.</li>
        <li>Now I have joined ITU to study BSCS.</li>

        <h3>ITU:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>My personal problems, particularly my financial ones since I grew up in a middle-class home, significantly influenced my outlook on life. Working hard has been a core life principle of my life since I have always witnessed others working hard to achieve their goals. Along with this, I also think one should work as wisely as possible and as needed because overworking oneself and disrupting one's state of mind simply results in burnout and decreased productivity.</p>
        <p>ITU being a well-known university with highly skilled resources for Computer Science in my home city, was inevitably my top choice.</p>
